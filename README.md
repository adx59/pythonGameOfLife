# GOL(python)
Game of Life by John Conway-implemented in Python. Board size is customizable(if you're willing to edit one line of code).

#Keyboard Controls

i = Do Iteration

p = Play

t = Set Iteration Interval

Sorry, but when you stop the play, you have to click the button instead of pressing the 's' button.
