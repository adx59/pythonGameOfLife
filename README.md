# GOL(python)
Game of Life by John Conway-implemented in Python. Board size is customizable(if you're willing to edit one line of code).

#Keyboard Controls

i = Do Iteration

p = Play

t = Set Iteration Interval

e = Export grid as grid.golp

r = Import grid.golp as grid

Sorry, but when you stop the play, you have to click the button instead of pressing the 's' button.

#Import/Export Capability

Alright, so I got bored, so I added a feature where you can export the grid into a text file. But of
course, I'm using a different format when exporting - .golp. I don't know why. J-just roll w/ it. The code
can still read through text files though.

By the way, as of 10:36 PST on Mar. 10, 2017, this feature doesn't come with a nice GUI. So I guess you have to 
use keyboard controls to import/export.

It's not that bad.

It's just the r and e key.
